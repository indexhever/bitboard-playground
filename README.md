# bitboard-playground
A playground to develop bitboard operations. This work is going to start as way to study common bitboard operations so in the future it will be a framework for developing board games which use bitboard operations to better map a game board.

The operations will be implemented using [this paper](http://eprints.qut.edu.au/85005/1/__staffhome.qut.edu.au_staffgroupm$_meaton_Desktop_bits-7.pdf) as a reference.
